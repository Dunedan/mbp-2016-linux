# State of Linux on the MacBook Pro 2016

The following document provides an overview about Linux support for the Apple
MacBook Pro 2016 line.

The MacBook Pro 2016 shares surprisingly many components with the Retina
MacBook (e.g. keyboard and touchpad controller, Wi-Fi and bluetooth chipsets,
...), so figuring out how things work on one device should benefit both device
families.

The checks if hardware works below were done with multiple Linux distributions.
To state the obvious: The newer the kernel the better. If in doubt which kernel
to use, the latest significant improvements are part of Linux 4.11.

If you don't know what the model identifier for your MacBook Pro is (as that
identifier is on several occasions below), check
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201300

## Audio input & output

Not working, neither the internal speakers/microphone nor the headphone jack.

What's working is audio via HDMI or any USB-connected audio device, so that can
act as a workaround until internal audio is working.

## Battery

Working fine, including the interface to get current capacity, temperature,
etc.


## Bluetooth

Not working.

Uses the same ACPI ID `BCM2E7C` as the Retina MacBooks, so certainly it's also
a `BCM43241`.

## FaceTime HD camera

In the MacBookPro13,1 (without Touch Bar) the FaceTime HD camera is connected
via PCIe, like in previous MacBook Pro's. It's working with the
[`bcwc_pcie`](https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie/wiki) driver.

The models with Touch Bar have the FaceTime HD camera connected through the
iBridge device via USB. They are exposed as regular USB video devices and work
after applying the following quirk using the `uvcvideo` driver:
```
echo "options uvcvideo quirks=0x100" > /etc/modprobe.d/uvcvideo.conf
```


## Graphics card

### Intel

Graphical output using the Intel GPU is working out of the box on the
MacBookPro 13,1 and 13,2, without dedicated AMD GPU. For the MacBookPro 13,3
with dedicated AMD GPU, only the AMD is enabled when booting a OS which isn't
macOS, so you have to follow the instructions in the following link to enable
the integrated Intel GPU, if you want to use it:
https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux/issues/6#issuecomment-286168538

Connecting external displays via USB-C-to-DisplayPort cables works fine,
including connections with daisy-chaining/MST. An actual tested and working
setup includes concurrent output on the internal display and two external
displays daisy-chained together with Full HD each.

### AMD

Working since Linux 4.9.

## Keyboard & Touchpad

Basic keyboard and touchpad functionality is working with the out-of-tree
driver developed for the Retina Macbook
(https://github.com/cb22/macbook12-spi-driver). As described on the Github page
the DSDT has to be patched to get it working.
Also ensure you have the `PXA2XX` SPI driver available:
```
CONFIG_SPI_PXA2XX=m
CONFIG_SPI_PXA2XX_PCI=m
```

After loading the driver the Touchpad isn't working from time to time.
Reloading the driver multiple times seems to fix it.

The Esc and function keys are part of the Touch Bar, so follow the
instructions for the [Touch Bar](#touch-bar) to get it working.

Beside the actual keyboard the power button and the lid close event work out of
the box.

## NVMe

MacBookPro 13,1 and MacBookPro 13,2:
- works with kernels >= 4.11
- lower versions of kernel need out-of-tree patch:
 http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-nvme/2016-May/004618.html
- alternative workaround:
 ```
 modprobe nvme
 echo 106b 2003 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvme/new_id
 ```

As the MacBookPro13,3 uses a different chipset for NVMe it works there out
of the box.

## Screen

Works out of the box.

Adjustable screen brightness only works out of the box for the models without
additional AMD Radeon GPU (MacBookPro13,1 and MacBookPro13,2). For the
MacBookPro13,3 with additional AMD Radeon GPU the following patch is necessary:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105051#c32

The only oddity noticed so far, is that the EDID data for the 13" model
describes two modes: `2560x1600` and `2880x1800`. Xorg probes and sets the
correct resolution of `2560x1600`.
For a detailed look into the EDID data, check out
[macbook13,2/card0-eDP-1.edid](macbook13,2/card0-eDP-1.edid).


## Suspend & Hibernation

Putting the MacBook Pro into suspend mode works, but it doesn't wake up again.


## System Management Controller

The System Management Controller is responsible for interactions with sensors,
fans and keyboard backlight.

Fans, temperature and voltage sensors work out of the box using the `applesmc`
kernel module, while the ambient light sensors only work in the MacBookPro13,1
and accelerometer sensors and keyboard backlight don't work for any model yet.
For these non-working parts, the SMC keys `applesmc` expects aren't available.


## Thunderbolt

Untested, but probably working with the following patch:
https://gist.github.com/l1k/3ffbd63ac337fa85530f6db3e9ee77e9

## Touch Bar

Not working out of the box, but thanks to @roadrunner2 basic functionality
is working using the driver you can find at:
https://github.com/roadrunner2/macbook12-spi-driver/blob/touchbar-driver-hid-driver/appletb.c

Missing is as of now just automatic dimming and the advanced functionality
with custom graphics Apple offers in macOS.


## Touch ID

Not working.


## USB

Works out of the box.


## Wi-Fi

The MacBookPro13,1 comes with a `Broadcom Limited BCM4350 802.11ac Wireless
Network Adapter` which works fine out of the box using the `brcmfmac` driver
(ensure you got the matching firmware package installed).

The MacBookPro13,2 and MacBookPro13,3 come with a `Broadcom Limited BCM43602
802.11ac Wireless LAN SoC (rev 02)` which is also supported by `brcmfmac`, but
has several issues, which could simply be firmware related:
* Only 2.4Ghz APs are shown
* Connecting to an AP barely works or fails directly

## Misc

### History of improvements per kernel version

#### 4.9

* Working AMD graphics of the MacBookPro13,3 (which is the only model with both
  Intel and AMD graphics).

#### 4.11

* The NVMe controller in the MacBookPro13,1 and MacBookPro13,2 is now working
  out of the box (the one in the MacBookPreo13,3 was already working before).
* When booting with kernel modesetting (KMS) the screen isn't scrambled during
  boot anymore.

### iBridge

The models with Touch Bar feature an additional USB device, called *iBridge*
(*Bus 001 Device 002: ID 05ac:8600 Apple, Inc.*). It's probably the interface
to the chip running iOS and providing access to the FaceTime HD camera (that's
why `uvcvideo` detects it), the Touch Bar (that's why it's shown as an
additonal input device in the Xorg log) and the Touch ID button.

`usb-devices` shows that *iBridge* exposes four interfaces:
```
T:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=02 Cnt=01 Dev#=  4 Spd=480 MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=ef(misc ) Sub=02 Prot=01 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  3
P:  Vendor=05ac ProdID=8600 Rev=01.01
S:  Manufacturer=Apple Inc.
S:  Product=iBridge
S:  SerialNumber=nomac?123456
C:  #Ifs= 4 Cfg#= 1 Atr=e0 MxPwr=0mA
I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 0 Cls=0e(video) Sub=01 Prot=00 Driver=(none)
I:  If#= 1 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=0e(video) Sub=02 Prot=00 Driver=(none)
I:  If#= 2 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=01 Prot=01 Driver=usbhid
I:  If#= 3 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=00 Prot=01 Driver=usbhid
```

The two `video` interfaces could be the FaceTime HD camera and the Touch Bar,
while the two `HID` interfaces could be the Touch Bar and the Touch ID button.

Booting macOS as a VM interestingly leads to the following changed output of
`usb-devices`:
```
T:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=02 Cnt=01 Dev#=  2 Spd=480 MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=ef(misc ) Sub=02 Prot=01 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  3
P:  Vendor=05ac ProdID=8600 Rev=01.01
S:  Manufacturer=Apple Inc.
S:  Product=iBridge
S:  SerialNumber=nomac?123456
C:  #Ifs= 8 Cfg#= 2 Atr=e0 MxPwr=0mA
I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 0 Cls=0e(video) Sub=01 Prot=00 Driver=uvcvideo
I:  If#= 1 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=0e(video) Sub=02 Prot=00 Driver=(none)
I:  If#= 2 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=00 Prot=01 Driver=usbhid
I:  If#= 3 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=10() Sub=00 Prot=00 Driver=(none)
I:  If#= 4 Alt= 0 #EPs= 0 Cls=02(commc) Sub=0d Prot=00 Driver=(none)
I:  If#= 5 Alt= 0 #EPs= 0 Cls=0a(data ) Sub=00 Prot=01 Driver=(none)
I:  If#= 6 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=00 Prot=01 Driver=usbhid
I:  If#= 7 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=f9 Prot=11 Driver=(none)
```

Seems like macOS somehow initalizes some additional capabilities of the
*iBridge*.

### Disable auto-boot

Apple introduced an "auto-boot" feature with the MacBook Pro 2016 causing the
notebook to be switched on, whenever the screen lid is opened. By modifying a
NVRAM variable this can be (luckily) disabled again.

How to do that from macOS as well as enabling the startup chime again is
documented e.g. at
http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/10/31/how-to-stop-the-new-macbook-pro-from-automatically-turning-on-when-the-lid-is-open/

To disable auto boot from within Linux, ensure that `efivarfs` is mounted and
run:
```
printf "\x07\x00\x00\x00\x00" > /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/AutoBoot-7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82
```

If you get "No space left on device" errors, it's probably because of
`dump-type0-*`-variables written by the Linux kernel taking up all space.
Removing them solves the problem:
```
for i in $(find /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/ -name 'dump-type0*'); do chattr -i $i; rm $i; done
```

With disabled auto boot the MacBook Pro will show the battery percentage for a
brief second as an image on the screen whenever you open the lid or plug in the
power cord while the lid is open.

To reenable auto boot again run:
```
chattr -i /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/AutoBoot-7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82
rm /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/AutoBoot-7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82
```
